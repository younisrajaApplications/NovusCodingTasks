Create a new project called FibonacciCalc. Write a method ‘Fibonacci’ (that is called from
your Main method) that prints out the first 100 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is found by adding up the two
numbers before it.
Starting with 0 and 1, the sequence goes 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so forth.
Written as a rule, the expression is x(n) = x(n-1) + x(n-2)
